# MarsRover

This App is my attempt at the [Mars Rover Tech Challenge](https://code.google.com/archive/p/marsrovertechchallenge/) on Google Code.

The Task is to develop some software to 'pilot' rovers around on a grid via parsing string input.  I felt that it would make a neat web app, so I did it in Angular 5.  This added a bit of complexity in parsing srings from a web ui and displaying the informatio, but I think it worked out well.  Some added improvements may be rover collisions, obstacles, and showing the path the rover takes.
